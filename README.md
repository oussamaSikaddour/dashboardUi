# 📊 Accessible Dashboard UI Components

This project provides a robust, pre-styled collection of user interface (UI) elements and components specifically designed for building modern, responsive dashboards. The core development philosophy prioritizes **web accessibility (A11y)**, ensuring that all components are usable by people with disabilities, including screen reader users and keyboard-only navigators.

## ✨ Key Features

* **100% Vanilla Tech Stack:** Built using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript** (no heavy frameworks or libraries), ensuring high performance and a small bundle size.
* **Accessibility First:** Components are developed following **WCAG guidelines** (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) for ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, focus management, and semantic HTML.
* **Comprehensive Component Library:** Includes all essential elements needed for a full-featured dashboard interface:
    * Navigation menus (sidebars, top bars)
    * Cards and widgets
    * Data visualizations (charts/graphs - *Note: You'll implement these with a vanilla library or canvas*)
    * Form elements (buttons, inputs, checkboxes, toggles)
    * Modals, tooltips, and dropdowns.
* **Easy Integration:** Simple structure allows for drop-in usage into any existing web project.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/oussamaSikaddour/dashboardUi.git
    ```
2.  **Open `index.html`:** View the complete component library and dashboard demo directly in your browser.
3.  **Start Building:** Copy the HTML/CSS/JS for the components you need into your project.

## 📚 Accessibility Best Practices Implemented

* **Semantic HTML:** Use of correct tags like `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`.
* **ARIA Attributes:** Strategic use of `aria-label`, `aria-describedby`, `aria-expanded`, and role attributes.
* **Keyboard Focus:** Proper `tabindex` management and visual focus indicators (`:focus`).
* **Color Contrast:** All color schemes are designed to meet **AA** contrast ratio standards.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML5**
* **CSS3** (with modern features like Flexbox )
* **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**
